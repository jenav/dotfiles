the neovim config includes 2 themes: ziggy and starlight

the ziggy theme is a hack of the moonfly theme trying to recreate the syntax highlighting found in the ziglang documentation website ([Zig Language Reference](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/)).

the starlight theme is a port from the helix one.
